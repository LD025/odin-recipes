        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Serve these fried green tomatoes outside with a glass of iced tea 
            one summer night and enjoy the sunset with someone you love. 
            You can also fry up red tomatoes with this recipe but 
            make sure they are not overripe or they will be mushy.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large green tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup outmeal</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Slice tomatoes 1/2 inch thick. Discard the ends.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs and milk together in a medium-sized bowl. 
                Scoop flour onto a plate. Mix cornmeal, bread crumbs, 
                salt, and pepper on another plate. Dip tomatoes into flour to coat. 
                Then dip tomatoes into milk and egg mixture; dredge in breadcrumbs 
                to completely coat. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Place tomatoes in hot oil in batches of 4 or 5, to prevent them 
                from touching; fry until crisp and golden brown on one side, then 
                flip and fry on other side. </li>
            <li>Transfer fried tomatoes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
                Repeat with remaining tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
